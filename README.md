This project demonstrates the fundamental operation of blinking an LED using an Arduino board. 

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to: Understand, Write and upload a program to the Arduino to blink the LED at specific interval.

## Key Activities

1. **Using Wokwi Simulator**
   - Connect the LED and Arduino board.
   - Ensure proper connections for power and ground.
2. **Writing the Arduino Code:**
   - Use the Arduino IDE to write the program for it but we can also use the simulator at that time to write the code.
   - Understand the structure of an Arduino sketch (setup and loop functions).
   - Use basic functions like `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, and `delay()`.

## Technology Used

- Arduino Uno: The microcontroller board used for this project.
- LED:Light Emitting Diode, the primary output component.
- Wokwi Simulator:The software used to write and upload code to the Arduino.

## Key Insights

1. **Understanding Basic Electronics:** Learn the importance of resistors in protecting LEDs from excessive current. Gain familiarity with basic electronic components and their functions.
2. **Arduino Programming Fundamentals:** Learn the basic structure of an Arduino program. Understand the use of digital pins for input and output operations.
3. **Practical Experience:** Gain hands-on experience in setting up a simple circuit and learn how to troubleshoot common issues in hardware and software.


## Conclusion

This project is the basic arduino ide programming to blink an LED. It is a good start for beginner.
